Hi! Welcome to **Science of Uselessness**.
This is a personal website I originally created
during COVID lockdown to display some
[engineering-meets-art ideas](projects) I developed for fun.
Since then, the site has also evolved into a
[professional portfolio](research).

Regardless whether you are looking into my
[professional](research) or
[private](projects) projects,
I hope you find some cool ideas here and
[you reach me out](about#contact) for feedback, appreciation, clarification, etc.

Have fun!
