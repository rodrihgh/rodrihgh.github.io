Hi! Welcome to **Science of Uselessness**.
This is a personal website I originally created to present some
[engineering-meets-art ideas](projects) I have developed in my free time.
Since then, the site has gradually evolved as a professional portfolio as well.

Regardless whether you are looking into my professional or side projects,
I hope you find some cool ideas here and
[you reach me out](about#contact) for feedback, appreciation, clarification, etc.

Have fun!
